## Overview

Creates a single SecretsManager Secret that can be used to hold some secret information.

## Pre-Commit hooks

[.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file defines certain `pre-commit` hooks that are relevant to terraform, golang and common linting tasks. There are no custom hooks added.

`commitlint` hook enforces commit message in certain format. The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your commit messages:

- **fix**: a commit of the type `fix` patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
- **feat**: a commit of the type `feat` introduces a new feature to the codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: a commit that has a footer `BREAKING CHANGE:`, or appends a `!` after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.
- **build**: a commit of the type `build` adds changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- **chore**: a commit of the type `chore` adds changes that don't modify src or test files
- **ci**: a commit of the type `ci` adds changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
- **docs**: a commit of the type `docs` adds documentation only changes
- **perf**: a commit of the type `perf` adds code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: a commit of the type `refactor` adds code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **revert**: a commit of the type `revert` reverts a previous commit
- **style**: a commit of the type `style` adds code changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **test**: a commit of the type `test` adds missing tests or correcting existing tests

Base configuration used for this project is [commitlint-config-conventional (based on the Angular convention)](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional#type-enum)

If you are a developer using vscode, [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=joshbolduc.commitlint) plugin may be helpful.

`detect-secrets-hook` prevents new secrets from being introduced into the baseline. TODO: INSERT DOC LINK ABOUT HOOKS

In order for `pre-commit` hooks to work properly

- You need to have the pre-commit package manager installed. [Here](https://pre-commit.com/#install) are the installation instructions.
- `pre-commit` would install all the hooks when commit message is added by default except for `commitlint` hook. `commitlint` hook would need to be installed manually using the command below

```
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

## To test the resource group module locally

1. For development/enhancements to this module locally, you'll need to install all of its components. This is controlled by the `configure` target in the project's [`Makefile`](./Makefile). Before you can run `configure`, familiarize yourself with the variables in the `Makefile` and ensure they're pointing to the right places.

```
make configure
```

This adds in several files and directories that are ignored by `git`. They expose many new Make targets.

2. The first target you care about is `env`. This is the common interface for setting up environment variables. The values of the environment variables will be used to authenticate with cloud provider from local development workstation.

`make configure` command will bring down `azure_env.sh` file on local workstation. Devloper would need to modify this file, replace the environment variable values with relevant values.

These environment variables are used by `terratest` integration suit.

Service principle used for authentication(value of ARM_CLIENT_ID) should have below privileges on resource group within the subscription.

```
"Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/write"
"Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/read"
"Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/delete"
```

Then run this make target to set the environment variables on developer workstation.

```
make env
```

3. The first target you care about is `check`.

**Pre-requisites**
Before running this target it is important to ensure that, developer has created files mentioned below on local workstation under root directory of git repository that contains code for primitives/segments. Note that these files are `azure` specific. If primitive/segment under development uses any other cloud provider than azure, this section may not be relevant.

- A file named `provider.tf` with contents below

```
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
```

- A file named `terraform.tfvars` which contains key value pair of variables used.

Note that since these files are added in `gitignore` they would not be checked in into primitive/segment's git repo.

After creating these files, for running tests associated with the primitive/segment, run

```
make check
```

If `make check` target is successful, developer is good to commit the code to primitive/segment's git repo.

`make check` target

- runs `terraform commands` to `lint`,`validate` and `plan` terraform code.
- runs `conftests`. `conftests` make sure `policy` checks are successful.
- runs `terratest`. This is integration test suit.
- runs `opa` tests

No modules.

## Resources

| Name | Type |
|------|------|
| [aws_secretsmanager_secret.secret](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/secretsmanager_secret) | resource |

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| <a name="input_description"></a> [description](#input\_description) | Description of the secret | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_kms_key_id"></a> [kms\_key\_id](#input\_kms\_key\_id) | ARN or ID of the AWS KMS key to be used to encrypt the secret values in the versions stored in this secret. If you need to reference a CMK in a different account, you can use only the key ARN. If you don't specify this value, then Secrets Manager defaults to using the AWS account's default KMS key (the one named `aws/secretsmanager`). If the default KMS key with that name doesn't yet exist, then AWS Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically the first time. | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_name"></a> [name](#input\_name) | Friendly name of the new secret. The secret name can consist of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and any of the following characters: `/_+=.@-` | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_policy"></a> [policy](#input\_policy) | Valid JSON document representing a resource policy. Removing policy from your configuration or setting policy to null or an empty string (i.e., policy = "") will not delete the policy since it could have been set by aws\_secretsmanager\_secret\_policy. To delete the policy, set it to `{}` (an empty JSON document). For more information about building AWS IAM policy documents with Terraform, see the AWS IAM Policy Document Guide: https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/aws/iam-policy | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_recovery_window_in_days"></a> [recovery\_window\_in\_days](#input\_recovery\_window\_in\_days) | Number of days that AWS Secrets Manager waits before it can delete the secret. This value can be 0 to force deletion without recovery or range from 7 to 30 days. The default value is 30. | `number` | `30` | no |
| <a name="input_replica_region"></a> [replica\_region](#input\_replica\_region) | REgion for replicating the secret. If not provided, no replication will be performed (default). | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_replica_kms_key_id"></a> [replica\_kms\_key\_id](#input\_replica\_kms\_key\_id) | ARN, Key ID, or Alias of the AWS KMS key within the region secret is replicated to. If one is not specified, then Secrets Manager defaults to using the AWS account's default KMS key (`aws/secretsmanager`) in the region or creates one for use if non-existent. Has no effect unless a `replica_region` is specified. | `string` | `null` | no |
| <a name="input_force_overwrite_replica_secret"></a> [force\_overwrite\_replica\_secret](#input\_force\_overwrite\_replica\_secret) | A boolean value to specify whether to overwrite a secret with the same name in the destination Region. Defaults to `false`, has no effect unless `replica_region` is specified. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| <a name="input_tags"></a> [tags](#input\_tags) | A map of tags to add to the resources created by the module. | `map(string)` | `{}` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| <a name="output_id"></a> [id](#output\_id) | n/a |
| <a name="output_arn"></a> [arn](#output\_arn) | n/a |
